# CNN-for-Handwriting-Recognition
CNN ie. Convolution Neural Network is one of the types of Neural Networks which is very useful for computational works using multilayer perceptrons(layers). These models work especially great for image processing tasks. For eg. Handwriting Recognition. Handwriting Recognition is one of the simplest and finest applications of Neural Networks.
